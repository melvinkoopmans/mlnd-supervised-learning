    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting, in the general sense, is used in many real-world applications. It's a very popular approach to machine learning and is often used in Kaggle competitions as well. Boosting is a meta-algorithm which aims to reduce the bias and variance by creating a strong learner from an ensemble of weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is one such boosting algorithm and works by weighting incorrectly classified samples such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases. Hence \"Ada\" which is short for \"adaptive\"; it adapts to the error rates of the individual weak hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above the power of boosting is that it creates a strong learner from an ensemble of weak learners. This difference can be quite dramatic. It is shown by Freund and Shapire [1] that if each weak hypothesis is slightly better than random, the training error drops exponentially fast. We are always trying to find the simplest model for our solution. AdaBoost lets us do this by using an ensemble of very simple models that are just slightly better than random guessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, even after the training error reaches zero, boosting continues to increase the margins of the training examples effecting a drop in the test error. This theory about margins suggests a connection between boosting and SVMs. Increasing the margin increases the confidence in our prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, AdaBoost does not require prior knowledge about the weak learner. This means it can be flexibly combined with any method for finding weak hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nice property of AdaBoost is that it tends to identify outliers because AdaBoost focuses its weight on the hardest examples (the hardest examples often turn out to be outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the weak classifier is too weak and is not expressive enough AdaBoost tends to underfit. \n",
    "AdaBoost can be susceptible to noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the weak learner is relatively complex the improved performance does not have such a compelling advantage over bagging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since bagging is a computationally cheaper and simpler algorithm one needs to consider whether the improvement in error is worth the additional computation time and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost tends to perform very well on a variety of benchmark machine learning problems [2]. It allows us to use simple models, which is we favor, by creating an ensemble of weak learners to create a single strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data contains much more samples with incomes lower than 50k, a ratio of 1:4. A naive estimator would guess that someone earns less than 50k and would be \"right\" most of the time. AdaBoost focusses on the harder examples (the cases when someone earns more than 50k) by weighing these examples more than the easier ones. I suspect that this will definitely improve the Fbeta-score of our final model.\n",

    "SVMs have been widely applied in the biological and other sciences. They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. Posthoc interpretation of support-vector machine models in order to identify features used by the model to make predictions is a relatively new area of research with special significance in the biological sciences. SVMs are also used for identifying among biological sequences. For example classification of genes, patients on the basis of their genes, and many other biological problems. SVMs are expanding its use in cancer genomics, leading to the discovery of new biomarkers, new drug targets, and a better understanding of cancer driver genes [1].\n",

    "Naive Bayes performs poorly. It gets an accuracy slightly better than random guessing (~60%) on the training set and even worse on the testing set, just over 40%. This leads us to the conclusion that Naive Bayes is not able to detect the relations between the attributes and the associated label. The same goes for the F-score. This model might be better for applications like text classification.\n",

    "**AdaBoost**\n",

    "\n",
    "**SVM**\n",
    "\n",
    "This model takes very long to train, and does not yield a higher accuracy nor a higher F-score. This leads us to the conclusion that SVM is not suitable for this task. That is, we can use a simpler model which is faster to train and has similar performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of adding the fourth classifier is because I wanted to compare Logistic Regression to Support Vector Machines. The main thing I'm trying to discover here is how well we can seperate our data linearly and how much benefit we would get from minimizing the margin error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can seperate our data quite well using a linear model and that we don't get too much benefit from minimizing the margin error. Logistic Regression has almost the same accuracy as the SVM, which is trained with a non-linear kernel. When it comes to the F-score Logistic Regression performs even better than the SVM. All-in-all we would definitely prefer Logistic Regression over Support Vector Machines for this task.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression and AdaBoost have very similar performance. AdaBoost takes a little longer to train but yields higher accuracy. I think this little bit of extra computation time is worth the higher accuracy and F-score. The final model is going to be **AdaBoost**"

    "\n",
    "The final model that we're going to use is AdaBoost. \n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost works by training several weak learners, such as a simple decision tree, to create a single strong learner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before elaborate on how the AdaBoost algorithm works I will first explain something about what we consider to be weak learners and decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is a simple model that will perform just slightly better than random guessing. On its own it is not strong enough to give us a good prediction. As I have said previously, a decision tree is one such weak learner. But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give an example of what a decision tree looks like. We start with one observation, which will be the \"root\" of our tree. We then split into two nodes, the branches of our tree. This split is chosen such that we obtain the most information. Decision tree become very clear when we illustrate it visually:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decision Tree](./decision_tree.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial observation, the root, is the education level. If someone is highly educated we assume that he is more likely to earn more money. Then we check how old someone is to determine how far he has probably advanced in his career. We can see that such a model captures some of the information of our dataset, it will perform better than random guessing. However, you can probably well imagine that this is simple model is not able to capture all of the relations in our dataset which eventually predict whether someone earns more than 50k or not. This is why a simple decision tree is a weak learner.\n",

    "The magic starts to happen when we create multiple of those simple decision trees to each produce a hypothesis. AdaBoost works by training a single weak learner on the data. Once that is done we identify which samples have been incorrectly classified, and increase the weights of those samples. We then use these new, weighted samples, to train the next weak learner. We repeat this step until we get the desired amount of weak hypotheses.\n",

    "Then we combine of all these weak hypotheses to get one final, strong, hypothesis. This combination happens by a weighted sum. If a weak hypothesis is relatively accurate it has higher weight: we listen more to this hypothesis. If a weak hypothesis is worse than random guessing, we listen much less to this hypothesis.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
